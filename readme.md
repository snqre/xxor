# XXOR

> `XOR<This, That>` â€” for when both outcomes are valid, and either is okay.

---

Where `Option<T>` means *maybe*, and `Result<T, E>` means *success or error*,  
**`XOR<A, B>` means two possible **success** outcomes** â€” without the noise of errors or missing values.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… `XOR<A, B>`: holds either `This(A)` or `That(B)`.

- ðŸ”’ `#![no_std]` compatible.
- ðŸ§ª Derives `Debug`, `Clone`, `Eq`, and `PartialEq`.
- ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for avoiding new `enum`s in small, focused cases.
